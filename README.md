linux-mint-config
=================

This config is useful, if you automatically want to add my favourite programs to a fresh Linux Mint 18.

Installation
------------

Don't clone the repository (That will be done automatically)! Either way, you shouldn't be able to clone the repo on your own, because on a fresh Linux Mint git is not installed.

Just download [post_install/](post_install), edit the email in [post_install.sh](post_install/post_install.sh), and run it.
