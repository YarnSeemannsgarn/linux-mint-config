ubuntu-config
=============

This config is useful, if you automatically want to add my favourite programs to a fresh Ubuntu.

Installation
------------

Don't clone the repository (That will be done automatically)!
Just download [post_install/](post_install), edit the email in [post_install.sh](post_install/post_install.sh), and run it.
